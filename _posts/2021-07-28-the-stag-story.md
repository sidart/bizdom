### Origin of the umbrella
The word ''umbrella'' comes from the Latin ''umbra'' meaning shade or shadow. The basic umbrella was probably invented by the Chinese over 4,000 years ago. It was used to be protection from the sun, not from the rain.  It meant a portable canopy of cloth or canvas, supported on a wooden or metal rod, used to protect from rain or the sun. Now the term is used as figurative meaning covering general protection, often without specific reference to a physical object.


Two centuries ago, there were no umbrellas in India—people mostly used palm leaves as protection from the sun or [monsoon rain](https://www.thebizdom.in/the-indian-monsoon-story/). By the end of the 1800s, the making of steel-wire umbrella frames had become a major industry in Britain. 

Around the same time, in 1860, Ebrahim Currim started a small workshop at Bazar Gate in Mumbai’s Fort area to deal in umbrellas imported from England. Over time, he learnt the art of making an umbrella. 

The umbrellas made by M/s Ebrahim Currim & Sons, initially, were all in black colour and doubled as walking sticks. That’s how the famous ‘Stag Umbrellas’ began. Today, theu claim, no matter what umbrella you buy, you'll be buying into something that has been carefully designed to make it easy for you.
