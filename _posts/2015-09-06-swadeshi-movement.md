Swami Dayanand in 1873 made Swadeshi as an article of Faith. Post that #AtmaNirbhar Bharat campaign had three phases (Before our Indendence), each resulting in some Hits and misses. But in totality, it did shape a few things which we see today in things around us. 

### Phase 1: The Boycott Campaign
The first version of Swadeshi was developed in western India. Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, along with Govind Ranade and Gopal Agarkar (Agarkar Chowk in Andheri, Mumbai is named after him) extended Dadabhai Naoroji’s Economic Drain theory and would eventually call for a boycott campaign in 1896. This was the first phase of nationalism. Around the same time, other events happened:
1.	1886: Jamsetji Tata renamed the newly purchased Dharamsi Mills as the Swadeshi Mills.Ironically, the first mill of the Tata’s was called Empress (based in Nagpur)
2.	1893: Profullachandra Roy started Bengal Chemicals in Calcutta, and Satis Mukherji started Dawn Society
3.	1897: Godrej got started with surgical instruments and & a security material in that became their biggest hit: the Desi Typewriter
4.	1894: Punjab National Bank was set up opposite Arya Samaj Mandir in Anarkali Bazaar at Lahore by Dyal Singh Majithia, founder of the Tribune newspaper.
5.	1908: Tilak raised contribution called the Paisa Fund for training men in industrial work, and formed the Paisa Fund Glass Works. 
All these individual efforts were like Garage Startups, and were looking for their booster event/trigger.

### Phase 2: Division of States
Today, many in India are fighting for separate statehood. Lord Curzon’s idea of dividing Bengal was the DeMo moment of that era. Bengal during that time was too big a state Comprising today’s WB, Bangladesh, Assam, Orissa, JH & Bihar. 
While Curzon division in 1905 was for administrative efficiency, it was treated as another divide-and-rule policy ploy. 
In the improved version of Swadeshi’, Muslim League was formed in 1906 at Dhaka. Rabindranath Tagore wrote “Sonar Bangla” to inspire the people emotionally. And, Swadeshi call of ‘Buy Indian and boycott British goods’ was given by Congress (and others). 

#### Meet: Ranchhodlal Chhotalal
He started his career as a clerk in EIC, and by 1847 had started a mill in Bombay. That had encouraged many Jain Bankers to start cotton mills in Ahmedabad. Swadeshi movement had now led to a spurt in the demand for Indian-made textiles, which means ~200 new mills in the Western India. The Tatas also used the Swadeshi agitation and appealed to this patriotic fervour to raise money for their most ambitious project. 

Back in Bengal, Sarala Devi <daughter of Janakinath Ghosal & from Tagore Family> opened “Lakhir Bhandar” in 1904, in the Bowbazar neighbourhood of Calcutta that sold only Swadeshi products. 

The Bengal Hosiery Co. was started by Muslim landlords and merchants. Their success made Bengal a major hub for hosiery (that’s why Bangladesh is so good in this). Footwear and tannery, flour mills, pottery and soap-making were also started as cottage industries.
Taking a cue from Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar’s Hindu Annuity, few insurance companies were formed. And in Madras on 15 August 1907 Indian Bank was started by Krishnaswamy Iyer, an activist lawyer. The Bombay Store was also started in Bombay by Munmohandas Ramji. 

By 1909, Congress started printing the Directory of Indian Goods and Industries. Indigenous entrepreneurship also spread into other consumer goods, like matchboxes and cigarettes. But it was not one-way traffic. Swadeshi dacoities were on rise and a counteract was also done. India was a big market for American companies, like BAT cigarettes. So, they started setting up their factories in Bengal to convince locals. It worked also that many Indian products were NOT as good. Thus, MNCs (Lever's) managed to win back their customers.


### Phase 3: Non-cooperation and revival of Swadeshi under Gandhi
Few more companies such as Calcutta Chemical Company launched Margo, Godrej also started their Desi Soap and Tata’s entered into many businesses. 
But the movement had taken a Hit. 
There was also an Anti-Non-Co-operation Society in Bombay by 1920 due to  the curtailed imports of foreign goods & limited production of it in India. The common man was devastated by the increase in domestic prices of commodities/products. 
Farmers rebelled and started salt Satyagraha and the freedom struggle picked up steam as a political repercussion. Gandhi had been toying many ideas to drive Nationalism and picked Swadesi (he was anyways mentee of Tilak), despite his call of the de-industrialisation of India in the 1920. 
Thus, the movement picked up steam again in the 1920s. Gandhi also pushed for hand-woven cloth in form of Khadi. The three Lalbhais brothers set up Arvind Mills to produce superfine fabric in the backdrop of the Swadeshi Movement of Gandhi. So did the family members of the Opium King in India. In 1923 a teenager who used to bottle a soft drink brand imported from Britain, decided to manufacture a soft drink with a unique alcohol like taste and named it Whisky No. It was launched in the state of Gujarat. 

Gandhi’s so called fifth son will soon play a key role. Gandhi actually acted like a matchmaker when he asked Bajaj to take over Mukund Steel since Mukund Agarwal wanted to leave the business and join him. Another key project was Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Mills (1931) in Lakhimpur Kheri of UP. 

#### Punjab	
Let's move to Punjab: Punjab had a very strong connect with the British Army and hence were exposed to machines as used by their English Sahibs. One day an English guy will ask a local Mochi to sew his football, thus it will trigger Sport Industry in Sialkot which was later sfited to Jalandhar post 1947.
Same way, inspired by their Sahibs Cycles and to reduce the imports. Some components, such as lamps, bells, stands, and carriers, will begin to be manufactured at Ludhiana by 1930s. Bishandas Basil from Ludhiana, will develop an Indian-made sewing machine (“Usha”) in Calcutta.

#### Others		
Mohanlal Dayal's family were primarily traders of silk and embroidery imported from Europe. It was under the influence of the Swadeshi movement that they switched to manufacturing confectionery in 1929. And soon launched the iconic brand of Comfort Food. 
The movement also inspired Abanindranath to incorporate elements of Chinese and Japanese calligraphy into his Mughal-inspired paintings of epic stories, and produced one of his most famous pieces—a depiction of Bharat Mata, or Mother India. The Swadeshi war cry thus had multiple meanings. For some it essentially signified our capacity to become a self-sufficient industrial nation; for others, like Gandhi, it was more about rejecting foreign machines and unpatriotic lifestyles and returning to traditional goods & tastes. 

Let me end with an interesting point. Motilal Nehru, was among the first Indian to own an automobile in 1907. Criticized for purchasing a foreign vehicle, he wrote to his son, “Would you advise me to wait till motor cars are manufactured in India.”
