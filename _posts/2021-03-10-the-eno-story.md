ENO began in the 19th century in the port city of Newcastle, England, when young pharmacist James Crossley Eno wanted to solve digestive problems. 
In 1850 at a little pharmacy in Britain’s Newcastle, James Crossley Eno developed an idea to improve the health of people by helping them deal with the digestive problems.  It was inspired by sailors who used to overeat when they returned to port and suffered from acid indigestion. 
James was determined to create a simple solution that could work in harmony with the body’s natural processes to relieve every kind of symptom caused by acid indigestion.
