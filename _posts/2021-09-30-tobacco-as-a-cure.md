During the mid-19th century, two prominent physicians began to champion smoking as a treatment for asthma. Many doctors thought patients could breathe easy if they puffed on pipes filled with tobaccoâ€”the belief, which appears bizarre now, was that smoke could heal the lungs. 

British physician Henry Hyde Salter, for instance, was one of its proponents. He prescribed tobacco and other sedatives for relief. He believed that asthma was caused by nervousness or excitement, which were said to lead to spasms of the bronchial tube muscles.
