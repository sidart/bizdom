Horlicks was founded in 1873 by two brothers James and William Horlick in their family run business. Based on its major product Horlicks, the company diversified into several other food businesses. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Horlick's was soon known as "the healthy drink for growing boys". 

Not many companies or brands can claim to have a mountain named after them. But Horlicks can. The Horlick Mountains, part of Transantartic Mountains of Antarctica, is named after William Horlick, one of the brothers who founded the Horlick Food Company in the US in 1873-75. William Horlick was a patron of Polar expeditions and supplied Horlicks malted drinks to explorers. 

The Horlick Mountain was discovered by an expedition team in the 1930s. 

Another fun fact: Horlicks was introduced to India by the British soldiers during World War Iâ€”they took it as a diet supplement.
