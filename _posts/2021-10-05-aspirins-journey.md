In 1897, scientist Dr Felix Hoffmann working in pharmaceutical firm Bayer in Wuppertal, Germany, synthesized a chemically pure form of acetylsalicylic acid. This became the drug Aspirin’s active ingredient. 

Aspirin was marketed in a powder form in 1899—delivered to medicine shops in 250-gram glass vials—but soon became the first drug to be sold in a tablet form. Bayer coined the term Aspirin from the Latin “a” for “from” and “spirsaure,” the German for “salicylic acid.” 

The conquest of space was also a race between the two superpowers of the time – the USSR and the USA.  However, one brand was common in their efforts.

> Both the Soviets and the Americans put together on-board pharmacies for their astronauts, and both included a number of basic components – above all drugs to combat complaints that could jeopardize the success of the missions, such as nausea, respiratory problems, gastrointestinal disorders and headaches. In 1967, NASA defined a list of priority drugs and active ingredients. At the very top was: acetylsalicylic acid, the ingredient of AspirinTM.
