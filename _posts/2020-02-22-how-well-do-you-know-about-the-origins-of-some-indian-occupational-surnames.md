---

“Occupational surnames” reflect the activities or jobs associated with our ancestors. These surnames and their frequency vary by region, language and social group within India. It all got started with the formation of the Kayastha caste in early medieval times wherein the professionals were drawn from different varnas/castes and crystallized into a caste of scribes. Soon these occupational specialization converted into hereditary and thus as the surnames.

The greatest number of Indian family names were derived from Sanskrit, however few occupational family names also came from Arabic and Persian (Farsi) -Dewan, Majmudar (record keeper), Malik, Shroff, Doshi, Sarkar, and Sood.  Plus adapted from western world, like Mistry (Portuguese), from mestre ‘master, expert’.

Most common occupational surnames in India provide an interesting insight into how Indian society has evolved. Occupational surnames in India reflect what individuals did for a living in order to earn an income. 

### Lord of the Land
People were awarded titles by native or foreign rulers, by the community, or by themselves. Some titles are simply honorific terms of address that have come down as surnames.  So, we have Bhatt ‘lord’,  Nair ‘leader’,  and Sarkar ‘lord’.
**Chakraborty** from Sanskrit /cakravartī/, literally ‘wheels rolling’, metaphorically a ruler whose chariot wheels roll everywhere without obstruction. Barua was another such title. 

**Deo** was again a title used by ruling families in northern India, and the name is found in several communities. This come from Sanskrit deva ‘god, lord’.
#### Village headman
Patel and Patil derive from ‘a piece of land’ and referred to a landowner/tenant farmer. Taluqdar = Taluk (depend) + dar (holder). Desai = lord of the Desa (land). All of them were responsible for collecting taxes for the kings. Reddy was another such title. 
**Chowdhury** were also the head of a community or caste, from Sanskrit /čatus-/‘four- way, all-round’ + /dhurīya/‘undertaking a burden (of responsibility)’. **Deshpande** and Deshmukhs were 'district accountant/leader’, formerly a hereditary office (from Sanskrit /deša/‘country, district’ + /pandita/‘learned man’). **Mehta** was another name used for the Chief (Sanskrit mahita = great and magnify) however in Gujarati it has come to mean ‘teacher’ or ‘accountant’. 
#### Shet, Shethi & Shetty
The Community name of Shetty and Chettiar derived from the Sanskrit word Shresthi (‘head of a mercantile or other guild’ and literally a superior person), since they were the best in the community on whom you can Trust on the money matters. 
Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, in his book Corporate Life in Ancient India said
> Sreni is defined as a corporation of people, belonging to the same or different caste but following the same trade and industry. This organisation corresponds to that of the "Guilds" in mediaeval Europa.

The term will becomes Seth/Sethia in northern India. 

While, the Nattukottai Chettiar community, or Nagarathars became a prominent mercantile caste in Tamil Nadu. What Marwari businessmen are to the north and Parsees to the west, the Nagarathars are to the south. While they migrated to many places, it was in Burma they grew tremendously as moneylenders. 

We derived Shenoy from the coastal Karnataka from the word ‘Shrenipati’ or the leader of the guild. It is also interchangeable with its Sanskrit counterpart Shanbhag or Shanbhogue which means clerk. 

**Mahajan** were moneylender named after mahā ‘great’ + janas ‘person’. Many caste had their own Mahajan to administer caste affairs and to also serve as an informal link between the merchants and the state.

Another related name was Lala used for bankers, merchants and tradesmen. Sindi drevied Lalani from Lala, simply meaning meaning 'descended from Lala'. Today it is used as both Muslim and Hindu surname. 


### Gyan
Sanskrit epithet āchārya ‘spiritual guide, learned man’. Another set of surname came from the folks who were ‘scholar’, ‘expert’ and ‘teacher’. So we have  Pathak and Upadhyay were ‘teacher’, Jani ‘learned one’,  and Vaidya ‘physician. The equivalent Muslim name was Afzal (learned man). 
**Chatterjee** /Chatta/, the name of a village,  /jhā/‘teacher’, hence ‘teacher from Chatta’. Bhattacharya were ‘learned instructor’. **Bedi** were the 'one who knows the Vedas’.  **Dave** and **Dubey/Dvivedī** were the ‘one who has studied two Vedas’.  Pandey and Pandya were pandita meaning ‘scholar’. And, Suri were priest or sage.

Mukherjee is a teacher from a place called Mukhati. Mukhyopadhyaya, is composed of mukhya ‘principal, chief’ + upadhyaya ‘teacher’.

Bhargava from Sanskrit bhārgava ‘(descendant) of Bhrigu’. Bhrigu is the name of one of the great sages. Jani is from jñānī ‘knowing, learned’. 

Jha (Ojha in Uttar Pradesh) is said to be a much reduced form of Sanskrit upādhyāya ‘teacher’. Joshi was a title for jyotisī , i.e ‘astrologer’.  Pathak is from pāthaka ‘teacher’.
### Mughals Era

Kothari were the treasurer and caretaker of “Kotha” (godown or treasure). Bhandari were the manager of the treasure house or keeper of a storehouse, taking care of the Bhandar. Both are also a surname in Marwadi communities.

Lunia were the salt makers. Sanghvi used to offers hospitality to groups and arrange such trips (Sanskrit sangha = Group)

Nahata were Rajput who later converted to Jain, got their name from a battle were they remain stood. Na + hata



### Ancestral place
A lot of Indian business communities picked their surname from their place of origin. While its not based on the occupational but still should be part of this list. 
**Aggarwal** came ‘from Agar or Agroha’, Ahluwalia ‘from Ahlu’, Irani ‘from Iran’, Lad ‘from southern Gujarat’, and Mathur ‘from Mathura’.  Many of the Marwadis picked their name based on this like Jhunjhunwala, Singhania, etc. So did the Khatris, Arora came from Aror (now Rohri, in Sind, Pakistan). 

### Others
Dhawan on the name of a clan in the Khatri (‘member of the warrior caste’ who later got into business) community. It is popularly believed to mean ‘runner’, ‘messenger’, from Sanskrit /dhāv-/‘to run’.  

Tandan derived from the Sanskrit dandanam or punishment, as, in ancient times, men of this caste were employed to carry out the punishments that were inflicted by the authorities upon offenders. Sawhney were the commander, **Handa** were into ‘cooking pot and Badal were into water.  Srivastava came  from Sanskrit šrīvasta ‘abode of wealth’). 

**Mittal** were Agarwal Bania community, probably derived from Sanskrit mitra ‘friend, ally’.  **Bhatia** were the mercantile community. Members of this clan claim relationship with the Bhatti Rajputs. 

Tanti, Tantuvaya the word means thread - wearer. It is an occupational name used by various weaving castes. Tunnaran were tailor, Uppu were the salt traders. Bahl is probably a derivative of Sanskrit bahala ‘strong’.  Bhasin is believed to be derived from Sanskrit bhāsin ‘sun’.

Parmar ‘one that strikes the enemy’, from Sanskrit para ‘alien, enemy’ + māra ‘strike, kill’. Purohit from purohita ‘one placed foremost’ (from puras ‘front’ + hita ‘placed’). Rawat from a much altered form of Sanskrit rājapatra ‘king’s son, prince’.
### Muslim Names
Muslim Khojas were another group of successful merchants. The name Khoja, or Khwajah, meant a rich and respectable gentleman, an opulent merchant. Bohras, also spelled Bohara or Vohra, is derived from the Gujarati word vohorvu meaning ‘trade’ and records the occupation of the first converters to Islam. The Memons another mercantile community, were known as maumins or believers. The word maumin was distorted to Memon.

**Afzal** (Arabic form: Afdal) ‘best’ or ‘learned’. Mukhtar was an 	occupational name based on Arabic mukhtār ‘chosen’, in some areas the title of a village chief. 
### European Connects 
Dubash (duâ’ + ‘bhash’ = translator) as an occupation got started a post-European entry, but as a surname was first used by Hormasji Pestonji Shroff who migrated in 1852 and started his business in Karachi, by calling himself as Dubash. In Goa you will find **Braganza** from the city of Bragança in Portugal.  Its the name of the royal house whose members occupied the throne of Portugal. Same way we have D’Souza minor places in Portugal or Spain named Sousa or Souza.
Da Silva came  name from Portuguese /silva/‘wood, thicket, bramble’. 


But remember this topic has its own complexibility and one can perhaps argue for another origin, Remember a Modi surname can be a Hindu bania (Lalit Modi) or OBC (PM Modi), Jain, Muslim (Syed Modi, the 8-time National Badminton champ, but for him it was a mistake done by his school teacher) or even a Parsi (Rusi Mody). 
Another example is Gandhi which is also an occupational name used by  Hindu (Bania, Arora, Jat), Jain, and Parsi (they used it as Gandy).
