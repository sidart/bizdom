#### Shet, Shethi & Shetty
The Community name of Shetty and Chettiar derived from the Sanskrit word Shresthi (literally a superior person), since they were the best in the community on whom you can Trust on the money matters. It becomes Seth/Sethia in northern India.

We derived Shenoy from the coastal Karnataka from the word ‘Shrenipati’ or the leader of the guild. It is also interchangeable with its Sanskrit counterpart Shanbhag or Shanbhogue which means clerk.

#### Mughals Era
Patel and Patil derive from ‘a piece of land’ and referred to a landowner/tenant farmer. Taluqdar = Taluk (depend) + dar (holder). Desai = lord of the Desa (land). All of them were responsible for collecting taxes for the kings.

Mughals followed a system of free minting under which anyone was free to bring metal to an imperial mint and get it converted into coins. Mints working under this were provided by a professional dealer in money = Sarraf, derived from Arabic meaning ‘treasurer’, ‘paymaster’.

Revenue collection of the Maratha State = assignment of revenue rights to a rent collector (ijardar), who were accountable to a group of moneylenders (Potedars, Poddars). When the state needed money, it would issue a money warrant accompanied by letter of credit to them.

#### Marwadis
Kothari were the treasurer and caretaker of “Kotha” (godown or treasure). Bhandari were the manager of the treasure house, taking care of the Bhandar. Both are a surname in Marwadi communities.
Parekh or Parikh were the assayer of metals and got derived from Sanskrit word pariksaka = 'examiner'. Related surname was Soni who acted as Sunar (goldsmiths)
Lunia = salt makers
Baid = Doctor
Sanghvi = offers hospitality to groups (Sanskrit sangha = Group)
Mehta = Chief (Sanskrit mahita = great)
Nahata were Rajput who later converted to Jain, got their name from a battle were they remain stood. Na + hata

#### European Connects 
Dubash (duâ’ + ‘bhash’ = translator) as an occupation got started a post-European entry, but as a surname was first used by Hormasji Pestonji Shroff who migrated in 1852 and started his business in Karachi, by calling himself as Dubash.


But remember this topic has its own complexibility and one can perhaps argue for another origin, Remember a Modi surname can be a Hindu bania (Lalit Modi) or OBC (PM Modi), Jain, Muslim (Syed Modi, the 8-time National Badminton champ) or even a Parsi (Rusi Mody).
