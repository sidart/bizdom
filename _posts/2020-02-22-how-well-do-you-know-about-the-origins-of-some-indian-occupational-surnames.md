---

“Occupational surnames” reflect the activities or jobs associated with our ancestors. These surnames and their frequency vary by region, language and social group within India. It all got started with the formation of the Kayastha caste in early medieval times wherein the professionals were drawn from different varnas/castes and crystallized into a caste of scribes. Soon these occupational specialization converted into hereditary and thus as the surnames.

The greatest number of Indian family names were derived from Sanskrit, however few occupational family names also came from Arabic and Persian (Farsi) -Dewan, Majmudar (record keeper), Malik, Shroff, Doshi, Sarkar, and Sood.  Plus adapted from western world, like Mistry (Portuguese), from mestre ‘master, expert’.

Most common occupational surnames in India provide an interesting insight into how Indian society has evolved. Occupational surnames in India reflect what individuals did for a living in order to earn an income. 

### Lord of the Land
People were awarded titles by native or foreign rulers, by the community, or by themselves. Some titles are simply honorific terms of address that have come down as surnames.  So, we have Bhatt ‘lord’,  Nair ‘leader’,  and Sarkar ‘lord’.
**Chakraborty** from Sanskrit /cakravartī/, literally ‘wheels rolling’, metaphorically a ruler whose chariot wheels roll everywhere without obstruction. Barua was another such title. 

**Deo** was again a title used by ruling families in northern India, and the name is found in several communities. This come from Sanskrit deva ‘god, lord’.
#### Village headman
Patel and Patil derive from ‘a piece of land’ and referred to a landowner/tenant farmer. Taluqdar = Taluk (depend) + dar (holder). Desai = lord of the Desa (land). All of them were responsible for collecting taxes for the kings. Reddy was another such title. 
**Chowdhury** were also the head of a community or caste, from Sanskrit /čatus-/‘four- way, all-round’ + /dhurīya/‘undertaking a burden (of responsibility)’. **Deshpande** and Deshmukhs were 'district accountant/leader’, formerly a hereditary office (from Sanskrit /deša/‘country, district’ + /pandita/‘learned man’). **Mehta** was another name used for the Chief (Sanskrit mahita = great and magnify) however in Gujarati it has come to mean ‘teacher’ or ‘accountant’. 

Nath, has its origins in a Sanskrit word “natha” meaning lord. Dhar was also village chief, a warlord, or the head accountant.

**Gowda** derived from a Dravidian word meaning “mountain”, so is a one who owns land and holds political and social power in the village.  Hegde, derived from the Old Kannada element “pergade,” meaning “chief.”

Samanta came from Sanskrit word “Saamant,” meaning “rich” or “chief.” It was also used as the title for a leader or head of a province.

The word ‘Menon’ is derived from ‘Menavan’ or ‘Melavan’ which essentially means ‘exalted person’. This was a title conferred upon the male heads of certain Nair families. When the British colonized India, many Menons were put in charge of maintaining the accounts of land.
#### Shet, Shethi & Shetty
The Community name of Shetty and Chettiar derived from the Sanskrit word Shresthi (‘head of a mercantile or other guild’ and literally a superior person), since they were the best in the community on whom you can Trust on the money matters. 
Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, in his book Corporate Life in Ancient India said
> Sreni is defined as a corporation of people, belonging to the same or different caste but following the same trade and industry. This organisation corresponds to that of the "Guilds" in mediaeval Europa.

The term will becomes Seth/Sethia in northern India. 

While, the Nattukottai Chettiar community, or Nagarathars became a prominent mercantile caste in Tamil Nadu. What Marwari businessmen are to the north and Parsees to the west, the Nagarathars are to the south. While they migrated to many places, it was in Burma they grew tremendously as moneylenders. 

We derived Shenoy from the coastal Karnataka from the word ‘Shrenipati’ or the leader of the guild. It is also interchangeable with its Sanskrit counterpart Shanbhag or Shanbhogue which means clerk. 

**Mahajan** were moneylender named after mahā ‘great’ + janas ‘person’. Many caste had their own Mahajan to administer caste affairs and to also serve as an informal link between the merchants and the state.

Another related name was Lala used for bankers, merchants and tradesmen. Sindi drevied Lalani from Lala, simply meaning meaning 'descended from Lala'. Today it is used as both Muslim and Hindu surname. 


### Gyan

In the same manner **Chatterjee** /Chatta/, the name of a village, hence ‘teacher from Chatta’, and a shorter version of Chattopadhyay.

Bhargava from Sanskrit bhārgava ‘(descendant) of Bhrigu’. Bhrigu is the name of one of the great sages. Jani is from jñānī ‘knowing, learned’. 

Jha (Ojha in Uttar Pradesh) is said to be a much reduced form of Sanskrit upādhyāya ‘teacher’. Joshi was a title for jyotisī , i.e ‘astrologer’.  Pathak is from pāthaka ‘teacher’. Dikshit/Dixit has their origin from diksha, meaning provider of knowledge. **Shastri** means “one who is proficient in the Sastras”.

Grover, came from Guruvara/Gorovare, which in turn derives from a Sanskrit word of (“guru/a” /गुरु”) “teacher/mentor” hence meaning “the great teacher”. **Upadhyaya**, also means “teacher” or “guru”.  Gangopadhyay / Ganguly were teachers from the Gangul Village, or near Ganga (Ganga + Upadhyaya). Mukhopadhyay were the Mukhya (main) Upadhyaya (guru).
### Mughals Era
The Mughals followed a system of free minting under which anyone was free to bring metal to an imperial mint and get it converted into coins. A significant proportion of the total clientele at the mints working under this agreement was provided by a professional dealer in money. They were named as Sarraf, which is derived from Arabic and Jewish word meaning ‘treasurer’, ‘paymaster’.

### Ancestral place
A lot of Indian business communities picked their surname from their place of origin. While its not based on the occupational but still should be part of this list. 
**Aggarwal** came ‘from Agar or Agroha’, and the community is split into 18 (according to some, 17 and a half) gotras. These include Bansal, Goel, Garg, Jindal, Kansal, Mittal, Singhal, etc.

Ahluwalia ‘from Ahlu’, Irani ‘from Iran’, Lad ‘from southern Gujarat’, and Mathur ‘from Mathura’.  Many of the Marwadis picked their name based on this like Jhunjhunwala, Singhania, etc. So did the Khatris, Arora came from Aror (now Rohri, in Sind, Pakistan).

Billimoria gets its name from Billimora, which was situated on the banks of the river Ambika, in Gandevi taluka and Navsari district of Gujarat state.
### Others

Tandan derived from the Sanskrit dandanam or punishment, as, in ancient times, men of this caste were employed to carry out the punishments that were inflicted by the authorities upon offenders. Sawhney were the commander, **Handa** were into ‘cooking pot and Badal were into water.  Srivastava came  from Sanskrit šrīvasta ‘abode of wealth’).

### Caste Names
The rise in the status of the members of the low castes as a result of education awakening has led them to discard old traditional names of their castes. 
Dhobi (washerman) became Prajàpati, Bhangi (scavenger) as Vàlmïki, Luhar (blacksmith) Vishvakarmâ, and Kalvar (one who deals in liquor) Jàisaval. In Panjab and in the nearby states, the surnames Khatri and Aurora are used by Hindu and Sikh trading castes. 

### Muslim Names
Muslim Khojas were another group of successful merchants. The name Khoja, or Khwajah, meant a rich and respectable gentleman, an opulent merchant. Bohras, also spelled Bohara or Vohra, is derived from the Gujarati word vohorvu meaning ‘trade’ and records the occupation of the first converters to Islam. The Memons another mercantile community, were known as maumins or believers. The word maumin was distorted to Memon.

**Afzal** (Arabic form: Afdal) ‘best’ or ‘learned’. Mukhtar was an 	occupational name based on Arabic mukhtār ‘chosen’, in some areas the title of a village chief. 

### The walas
The Parsi community did not adopt surnames until the age of the British rulers. During the British rule, to be able to identify and track people, the Britishers demanded a list of Indian family names, esp in the cities. So most Urban families decided to adopt their profession as their family name as all the men of a family would be in the same trade. The suffix wala is used to identify the profession of the person. 

So, we got surnames like: Canteenwalas, Confectioners, Messmans, Bakerywalas, Hotelwalas, and Commissariats, for the folks who were in the food business. Those who dealt with bottles were Batliwala, those into medicine industry were Daaruwala, daaru being a term used for medicines. Plus, we had Mistry, Builder and Contractor. 
### European Connects 
Occupational surnames are amongst the most common in England. And, given our recent knowlegde about English langauge, their occupational surnames are way easy to identify. So, it can be  a trade Clark (cleric who went out to houses to administer the services), Thatcher (tanner’s helper; one who worked with leather) other e.g., Baker, Cooper, Butcher, Shoe Maker or a general profession (e.g., Gardner, Sheppard).  
Chapman, or Chipman were the trader who bought and sold articles. It also led to the words ‘chap,’ ‘cheap’ and ‘chop’. 
So, we will now touch upon some of the lesser known and with Indian connections.

Dubash (duâ’ + ‘bhash’ = translator) as an occupation got started a post-European entry, but as a surname was first used by Hormasji Pestonji Shroff who migrated in 1852 and started his business in Karachi, by calling himself as Dubash. Inginear were the Engineer.

In Goa you will find **Braganza** from the city of Bragança in Portugal.  Its the name of the royal house whose members occupied the throne of Portugal. Same way we have D’Souza minor places in Portugal or Spain named Sousa or Souza.
Da Silva came  name from Portuguese /silva/‘wood, thicket, bramble’.  Pinto could have been painters.

#### End
But remember this topic has its own complexibility and one can perhaps argue for another origin, Remember a Modi surname can be a Hindu bania (Lalit Modi) or OBC (PM Modi), Jain, Muslim (Syed Modi, the 8-time National Badminton champ, but for him it was a mistake done by his school teacher) or even a Parsi (Rusi Mody). So, Modi can be a merchants, traders, or shopkeepers.
Another example is Gandhi which is also an occupational name used by  Hindu (Bania, Arora, Jat), Jain, and Parsi (they used it as Gandy).
