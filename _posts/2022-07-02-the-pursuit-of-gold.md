## A Golden Narrative
Narratives are how we make sense of the world; they can explain why something is happening to us or why something happened that didn’t actually happen. And sometimes we create narratives out of nothing as a way to try and shape the world into what we want it to be.
Some stories are magical. The world of myth at time wove history, religion, science, and superstition. In that context let me start the Story of real KGF.

Mareecha is Ravana’s maternal uncle. Ravana approached him, “You must help me capture Sita,” he commanded. Mareecha advised against the plan, Ravana threatened him, “Do as I say, or you shall be put to death.”
Afraid of Ravana’s wrath, he transforms himself into a golden deer that Sita desires for, and becomes vulnerable to Ravana’s abduction ploy.
Mealwhile, Rama while chasing Mareecha realized that this was no golden deer but a demon. Rama shot him dead with an arrow and the deer burst into small fragments. That is the epic mythological history of why South India has Gold mines. 

### The Birth of Kolar

The first capital of the Ganga kings bore the sweet sound Kuvulala, later known as Kolala, which got modified to Kolara or Kolar. Thus Kolar, came to be known as the capital city of this dynasty. The second king of the Ganga dynasty, born in Kolar towards the end of the second century, bears in one inscription the title “touchstone of gold”. 

The hills of Nandydrug in Kolar remained a parallel power centre. No ruler from adjoining Mysore areas was able to win it. Until Hyder Ali (who was born in Kolar only, the father of Tipu Sultan, conquered the hillocks and the adjoining lands and made them a part of his kingdom in the year 1765.

Gold has been mined here for ages—it is said that The Champion Reef in the region was excavated to a depth of 50 metres during the Gupta period (5th century A.D.). The Vijayanagar empire (1336-1565) and Tipu Sultan continued (attempted) these mining activities.
Hopeium 
Hope and faith are close bunched immensities that can both be destructive forces or powerful tools.

Tipu Sultan who had waged four wars against British -the Anglo Mysore wars, had been defeated and killed by the British troops in Srirangapatnam, his capital.  Post-war, the British decided to hand over Tipu's territory to the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore. But, before the handover, the land was to be surveyed. And, to complete this task, Lieutenant John Warren was summoned.

This curious lieutenant had other things on his mind as he was out on his own private mission, his mind was on prospecting for Gold.

Two years earlier a pundit had told him that in prosperous years, when the gods favoured the land with copious rains, the village of Kadogi, now and then, grew grains of gold on the ears of plants in the paddy fields. So, he was HIGH on HOPEIUM.

He spent 3-4 years, even offering a reward to the local people for information on gold available anywhere. But he found nothing. Now, when People are mesmerized with confidence, they believe in their stories. So, Lieut. Warren wrote the first authentic record of the gold in the Kolar district in his report in The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British India and Its Dependencies in 1810s. 

In the next few decades of this report not much happened. But, when the gold rush in California and the Australian continent were over by 1850, there was renewed interest to look at other sites of the world, for Gold. The mining journals in England were full of advertisements for investors, folks were looking for Gold across the British Crown. And, by, the late 1870s and early 1880s saw a boom in Southern India.

Meanwhile, around 1860, a small syndicate of military residents in Bangalore, the cantonment town for the British troops was formed. This group was young and eager to invest its surplus cash. The syndicate had enough capital to risk on new startups and was keen on prospecting and mining. But, alas no gold was found by any of the ventures started by this group. 
But then, Hope is the opposite of resignation. The Call for “Wish-We-Would have done little more effort” remained with most of them. And they kept on talking about Gold and Kolar as they returned back to Bangalore. The Hope of Gold was still there in this Anglo- Indian syndicate 

Mr. Lavelle 
Michael Lavelle, an Irish soldier returned to Bengaluru for recuperation. While he was in New Zealand, he had learnt something about gold mining. The buzz about the possibility of gold in Kolar led him to prospecting and he set off to that district in 1871. Within 2 years, he applied to the Mysore government for a license to prospect for coal and other minerals.
Why Coals?
Maybe he wanted to  hide his real intention of looking for gold, and bring down the license fee. And, given not much of Gold was been found in the recent past, he had no trouble for this Plan!
But Mr. Lavelle was also a smart operator, given he was not very rich, he again ogt few wealthy backers and just within 3 years of his 20-years lease, he managed to pass on the licencing/ mining rights to Maj.Gen. de la Poer Beresford of the Madras Staff Corps. The greater fool theory was very much in play!

Lavelle was now rich enough to live a lavish life back in Bangalore, though he will try to get back into action, but his role in this story is over. Just that you should know that the famous Lavelle Road in today’s Bengaluru is named after him. He also renamed his house as “Oorgaum House” after the first shaft that he sank in Urigaum.

It takes courage to keep going, especially after a failure, but it is this that makes all the difference in achieving our goals. While the parties kept on changing, but someone from the Anglo-Indian society kept trying their luck for the Gold Rush.

The Gold Rush
By July 1881, eleven companies had been formed in Kolar with a capital of £ 
1.2 million. By 1883, all the companies were struggling but had one exception: the Mysore Company owned by Messrs. John Taylor & Sons registered in London. 
Kolar Gold Field’s modern success is attributed to the British company John Taylor & Sons. The company acquired the mines in 1880 and ran them until 1956.  Their motto was: ‘Don’t give up at early failures’ and they were not just successful here in India, but even in Australia (Charters Towers and Tasmania), New Zealand (Waihi), and Africa also (Egypt and Sudan). But their 'jewels in the crown' were the gold mines of Kolar only, Champion Reef, Ooregum & Nundydroog. The development and management of KGF was started by John Taylor III, the grandson of the founder of the London company. 


Progress, Progress & Progress
Progress is the ability given to us by nature, to better our surroundings. For the love of the money (err. Gold)

The hunt for Gold had its spillover effects. As many families shifted to India, across the Global British Crown, there was another problem. While husbands were ready to toil in the hot barren land of Kolar, their wives and kids were finding it difficult to stay back. So, on April 27, 1882 the Maharaja of Mysore granted the ‘Eurasian and Anglo-Indian Association of Mysore and Coorg’ nearly 400 acres of land for an agricultural settlement in Mysore State, a little east of British Bangalore. Today, we know this part as Whitefield. Though it was named after D. S. White, who was the founder of the Anglo Indian Association, it also suggested the literal meaning of White poeple’s Agricultural land.

The discovery of gold—in quantities beyond anyone’s wildest imagination—had started transforming Kolar. By 1893, the railways were extended up to the Kolar gold fields. In 1902, Kolar Gold Fields became the first mining region in the world to use electric power. The mines were electrified with a 140-kilometre cable run by General Electric from the hydroelectric power plant at Shivanasamudra Falls—the first hydroelectric project of India. With Power, came the English People also.
A new colonial settlement sprang up on the outskirts of the mines, complete with bungalows, clubhouses and gymkhanas.


Social Challenges 
The only thing the movie KGF resonate with the real story is the dreadful working condition of the workers. In 1897, a deadly rock-fall and landslide inside the Mysore Mine had killed upwards of fifty workers, injuring hundreds more. Sickness of all sorts was a constant presence in form of cholera, dysentery, malaria, asthma and lung cancer.
“When dusk fell, workers would stumble out of the mines and their work-stations and many would turn their faces toward the local liquor shops or gambling dens even though wives and children waited for them at home. “
All the workers were made to labour 8,000 feet underground, without any provision of air till 1936. 

In addition, the possibility of theft of this valuable object led to an ‘extraordinary levels of surveillance’.
Decline

Sometimes growth and progress occur in an uneven manner that it prevents us from viewing our present as a permanent condition. By the 1920s, the mining industry was at its peak. KGF occupied 30 square miles and the population was nearly 90,000. That’s when the decline got started. Hundreds of miners died in rockbursts in the 1920s and 1930s. Quite a few were buried alive. Many succumbed to diseases and unsafe conditions. leaving Kolar a deindustrialised ghost town by the late twentieth century.
This started the labour problems, and it got boost from the on-going India’s independence protests. John Taylor’s mines demanded dirt-cheap labour. Thos cost advantage was going away. 1940s first trade union was formed in KGF. Labour issues and decline in production happened in the next decade. And, in 1953 the oorgaum gold mines were closed. WIthin 3 years most of the companies were nationalised. 
In 1972 all the KGF mines were Amalgamated as Bharat gold mines limited (BGML).
While, many believe the veins of gold have yet not quite run out, since a large seams still remain unexplored, yet successive governments have been trying to shut down Bharath Gold Mines Ltd (BGML).

The Legacy 
5% of the Gold mining profits were given to the Mysore treasury as royalty. These measures helped the treasury and avoid a bit of public taxation. It also helped the Mysore state to fund some of their own large-scale projects. Like, Krishna Raja Sagara dam, etc. A lot of these were done by Sir Mokshagundam Vishveshwarayya, often referred to by his initials, MV. Sir M.V. was born to Srinivasa Sastry and Venkachamma at Muddenahalli village in the Kolar district. His father was a Sanskrit scholar and an authority on the Hindu scriptures, besides being an Ayurvedic practitioner. 

The Anglo-Indian community also have few strong connections with KGF. 
LT Boosey was a national triple jump champion in British India and had appeared for the country in several international events. His son, Derek Boosey (born in Kolar) also has had a long association with track and field representing Great Britain at the 1968 Mexico Olympics.
Stuart Clark, an Australian cricketer who played for New South Wales and the Australian group. While his dad Bruce Clark was from Madras,  his mom Mary Clark was from the Kolar Gold Fields.

Bezwada Wilson, who won a Magsaysay Award in 2016 for his work to eliminate manual scavenging, is a Dalit born in 1966 into a family that lived by manual scavenging. He also grew up in the Kolar Gold Fields.
