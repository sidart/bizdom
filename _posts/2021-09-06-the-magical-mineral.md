A diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a rigid crystalline structure, forming one of the hardest substances known. A diamond is a pure crystal of carbon with no skeletons, no imperfections. But there something more intresting about it.

Diamond is a precious gemstone that has been prized for thousands of years.  India knew about diamonds for at least 3,000 years, according to some experts. According to ancient myths, diamonds are also supposed to have magical properties to protect against any poison or attack. In Sanskrit, it was addressed as ‘vajra’, ‘thunderbolt’ and ‘indrayudha’ – warrior god Indra’s weapon. 

But where did the English name for diamond come from? Well, ancient Greeks knew about the mineral too and ancient civilizations thought of diamonds as something invincible, one with magical properties. The word derives from the Greek word ‘adamao’, which meant ‘I subdue’. 

The adjective ‘adamas’ implied the hardest substance, a reference to the hardness of the gemstone. Latin writers, at times, used the word as ‘adamant’ and ‘adimant’ among other variations. Over time, the words changed form to ‘diamant’ and finally came to be known as diamond.
